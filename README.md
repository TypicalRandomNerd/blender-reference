# Blender Hotkeys

Blender has quite a different workflow than traditional 3D graphics suites. Unlike most industry standard suites, Blender takes a hotkey heavy approach (although just using the GUI is definitelly feasible). To fully appreciate the workflow in which Blender is designed around it is important to understand the shortcuts and what they do.
